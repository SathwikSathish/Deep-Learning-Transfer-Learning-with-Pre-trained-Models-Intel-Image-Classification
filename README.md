## Overview

This repository contains a project on transfer learning in deep learning, focusing on the Intel Image Classification dataset. We explore the concept of transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models for computer vision tasks. The project showcases the adaptability and effectiveness of popular models like Inception V3, VGG 16, and ResNet50 with ImageNet weights.

## Dataset

The Intel Image Classification dataset consists of various outdoor scene images categorized into six classes: 'buildings', 'forest', 'glacier', 'mountain', 'sea', and 'street'. The dataset provides an ideal testbed for evaluating transfer learning methods.

## Models Used

1. Inception V3 (H5 weights)
2. Inception V3 (ImageNet weights)
3. VGG 16 (ImageNet weights)
4. VGG 16 (weights loaded from a file)
5. ResNet50 (ImageNet weights)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/transfer-learning-intel-image-classification.git
